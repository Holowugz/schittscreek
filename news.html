    <p><strong>Each Main Character's Best & Worst Workplace Decision</strong><br><br>
      While Schitt's Creek is not a workplace sitcom like The Office, work does feature as a 
      big part of the story. With the Rose family losing all of their money and their life of luxury, 
      they are each faced with having to get a real job. Some of them find success while others struggle 
      in certain positions.<br><br>
      
      Along with the Roses, the show also explores the other colorful characters who make up the main cast 
      and their work lives. This results in moments of people really impressing others with their work decisions 
      as well as some scenes of some ill-advised professional choices.</a></p>

      <p><strong>Toronto Mansion from Schitt's Creek is back on the market for almost $20m</strong><br><br>
        The Toronto mansion that makes a brief appearance in Schitt's Creek as the Rose family's home 
        before being repossessed by the bank has been relisted with a new whopping price of nearly $20 million.<br><br>

        The nine-bedroom, 16-bathroom home, called "La Belle Mansion," is located at 30 Fifeshire Rd. in the 
        York Mills and Bayview area and has been on and off the market several times since 2018, with the price 
        likewise fluctuating each time.<br><br>
        
        And after hitting the market with a price tag of $14,980,000 at the end of August 2020, the mansion 
        has been relisted with a price adjustment of $19,880,000.</a></p>

      <p><strong>7 Shows Like Schitt's Creek You Should Watch If You Miss Schitt's Creek</strong><br><br>Schitt's Creek started out as a cult favorite Canadian sitcom and grew into an Emmy-winning powerhouse. 
        The feel-good comedy gave fans the most satisfying, heartfelt conclusion possible, but even when beloved 
        shows wrap up well, they can be hard to let go of. And as fun as it is to rewatch the misadventures of the 
        Rose family, sometimes you just want to enjoy a new show. If you're looking to expand your TV horizons but 
        stay true to the feeling of Schitt's Creek, look no further.<br><br>

        While no other show may ever do exactly what Schitt's Creek did, there are plenty of other series 
        out there that will remind you of the things that made you fall in love with the Roses, their kooky town, 
        and its even kookier inhabitants. Whether you're looking for another sitcom about a chaotic family, or one 
        with three-dimensional LGBTQ+ characters, or just something that serves up smart, fast-paced comedy, we very 
        well might just have the show for you.</a></p>
